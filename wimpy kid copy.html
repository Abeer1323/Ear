        It's a new school year, and Greg Heffley finds himself thrust into middle school, where undersized weaklings
        share the hallways with kids who are taller, meaner, and already shaving. The hazards of growing up before
        you're ready are uniquely revealed through words and drawings as Greg records them in his diary. In book one of
        this debut series, Greg is happy to have Rowley, his sidekick, along for the ride. But when
        Rowley's star starts to rise, Greg tries to use his best friend's newfound popularity to his own advantage,
        kicking off a chain of events that will test their friendship in hilarious fashion.

        Secrets have a way of getting out, especially when a diary is involved. Whatever you do, don't ask Greg Heffley
        how he spent his summer vacation, because he definitely doesn't want to
        talk about it. As Greg enters the new school year, he's eager to put the past three months behind him . . . and
        one event in
        particular. Unfortunately for Greg, his older brother, Rodrick, knows all about the incident Greg wants to keep
        under wraps.
        But secrets have a way of getting out . . . especially when a diary is involved. Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick
        Rules chronicles Gregâ€™s attempts to navigate the hazards of middle school,
        impress the girls, steer clear of the school talent show, and most important, keep his secret safe.

        Let's face it: Greg Heffley will never change his wimpy ways. Somebody just needs to explain that to Greg's
        father. You see, Frank Heffley actually thinks he can get his son to toughen up, and he enlists Greg in
        organized sports
        and other "manly" endeavors. Of course, Greg is able to easily sidestep his father's efforts to change him. But
        when Greg's dad threatens to send him to military academy, Greg realizes he has to shape up . . . or get shipped
        out.
